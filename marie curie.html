<p  style= "font-family: monospace " > <font= style="font-size:15px"> Marie Curie was a Polish and French physicist. Marie Curie is remembered for her discovery of radium and polonium, and her huge contribution to finding treatments for cancer.<p>
<p  style= "font-family: monospace"> <font= style="font-size:15px"> She was the first person to win two Nobel Prizes. Together with her husband, she was awarded half of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903, for their study into the spontaneous radiation discovered by Becquerel, who was awarded the other half of the Prize. In 1911 she received a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, in recognition of her work in radioactivity. Indefatigable despite a career of physically demanding and ultimately fatal work, she discovered polonium and radium, championed the use of radiation in medicine and fundamentally changed our understanding of radioactivity. <p>

<p style= "font-family: monospace " > <font= style="font-size:15px">  Marie Curie's decades of exposure left her chronically ill and nearly blind from cataracts, and ultimately caused her death at 67, in 1934, from severe anemia, but she never fully acknowledged that her work had ruined her health.
 On 4 July 1934, at the Sancellemoz Sanatorium in Passy, France at the age of 66, Marie Curie died. The cause of her death was given as aplastic pernicious anaemia, a condition she developed after years of exposure to radiation through her work. She will always remain a role model to us all.
